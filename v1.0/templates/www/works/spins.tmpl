      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>The spins began in 2011 as abstract circular oil paintings on acrylic and glass discs and since then have developed through a series of studies involving a variety of media and contexts. Their abstract yet painterly nature serves as an ideal petri dish for wide ranging examinations into the perception and effects of art. In the <a href="{{ root_path }}works/imagereactionstudies.html">Image Reaction Studies</a> where the spins appear on pre-existing images, we examine how abstract shapes can obtain purpose and affect the mood of the underlying image. Similarly in the <a href="{{ root_path }}works/placereactionstudies.html">Place Reaction Studies</a> spins on glass are arranged about a room in order to examine how we can exercise editorial control in how the room is perceived by the viewer. In contrast, the <a href="{{ root_path }}works/tastestudies.html">Taste Studies</a> are deliberately kept abstract and instead focus on evolving a colour palette to the taste of the viewing public.</p>
