      <p>Walking around the Space for Sale show, situated in a soon-to-be-let commercial premises, there is a vague sense of being cheated. On the walls are a series of drawings and paintings showing large bold advertisements for Magna Building Supplies, Cadbury's, Bristol Beer Factory and Bristol Fine Art rendered mostly in garish acrylic paints, the centrepiece is a to-scale bronze cast of a DeWalt drill. You cannot help notice how traditional artistic practices have been subverted to push the advertisers message &ndash; the buffed bronze of the drill drives the iconic yellow DeWalt branding, the Drawing School sketches are `signed' with contact details and prices for classes, even the drinks and 'buffet' provided on the closing night were sponsor provided.</p>


      <p>Before the show took place Matthew contacted various enterprises about the possibility of some small scale advertising but with a high potential to go `viral'. The promise was an audience who is viewing of their own volition and will likely spend a significant amount of time and mental energy absorbing whatever message was presented on the work. In return Matthew would collect a `fee' in terms of goods or services. The work generated is not a traditional artistic commission however since ownership rights to the piece are retained by the artist. The result is a series of pieces which generally reflect a painterly version of the company or product logo with embellishments which are reminiscent of pre-modernist advertising. Any leftover space in the gallery was taken up with `placeholder' canvases with a web address containing the contact details necessary to fill the spot.</p>

      <p>On the final night of the show, the artist held an auction for the works, presumably to further exploit the commercial gain from the audience where all the pieces were put up for bidding. This description may appear cynical at first but the atmosphere of the final night &ndash; in no small part due to the sponsored Sunrise beer &ndash; was very positive and, during the auction, even euphoric. Although the works were relatively highly commoditised &ndash; allegedly some were created in the early morning before the opening &ndash; all of them were sold with the exception of the bronze drill.</p>

      <p>The show raises a range of questions &ndash; Is there a link between commoditisation and broader appeal in art (why do Ikea prints sell so well)? Where is the line between advertising and art (if there is one)? Does the artist have a responsibility not to cross it? Does the future of commissions lie with commerce rather than individuals? If art is used to deliver a message from an enterprise (an advert), should it be displayed in a public gallery? Is the individual artist him/herself an enterprise? Although industrialisation and mass-production has been scrutinised in art since the Pop Art movement, ultimately the focus of Pop Art was on the imagery and reflecting on the wider society. Art Space for Sale has a much sharper focus on questions on the authenticity and the integrity of the artist.</p>

<p>In the end, I bought a small placeholder piece which went for a very low &pound;7, although there was again a feeling that perhaps I was the butt of a joke &ndash; my attention had been exploited and now also my wallet. Nonetheless it is still hanging in my room despite the fact that very little craft had gone into the piece, a reminder of what commercialisation can bring, namely cheap commodities.</p>
